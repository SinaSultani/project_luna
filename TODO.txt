LAST DONE:
On friday 16/12: Photos are being uploaded to storage in separate folders by user.
Seems everything works fine, maybe to try on real device to see if it is slow.

TODO: 

1. Check if "Take Photo" function works and to make it save to database if we want;

2. Set up some nice icons for the bottom menu;

3. Explore how to send DM to other users via firebase;

4. Check with Sina what he has done in his app to get some ideas.

5. Separate firebase stuff to separate provider??
