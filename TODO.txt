LAST DONE:
On friday 16/12: Photos are being uploaded to storage in separate folders by user.
Seems everything works fine, maybe to try on real device to see if it is slow.

TODO: 

1. Check if "Take Photo" function works and to make it save to database if we want;  DONE

2. Set up some nice icons for the bottom menu; DONE


IN PROGRESS
3. Explore how to send DM to other users via firebase;
    a. created Messages view/stack that shows users that have name in db.
    b. created Message view to enter that specific users DM (not user when data comes if it will be specific)
       Do I need a separate component or to try with { ? : } to see view for specific users messages, dont know
    c. check how to implement messages in db.



4. Check with Sina what he has done in his app to get some ideas.

5. Separate firebase stuff to separate provider??

6. create gallery to show photos from storage.
