Create a "friend requests" collection in your Firestore database with fields such as "from", "to", and "status" (e.g. "pending", "accepted", "declined").

In your React Native app, when the "add friend" button is pressed, create a new document in the "friend requests" collection with the "from" field set to the current user's id and the "to" field set to the other user's id.

When the other user logs in, retrieve all friend requests where the "to" field is set to their id and display the requests in a list.

When the other user receives a friend request, they can either accept or decline the request.

If the other user accepts the request, add both the current user and the other user to eachothers friends
